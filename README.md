# Travel Booking Web App

## Description

I created a travel booking web app that makes finding and booking flights super easy. You can search for flights by entering your arrival and destination locations, and travel dates. The app lets you pick your seats and securely pay through the Midtrans API. It has a sleek, modern look thanks to Shadcn UI components and TailwindCSS. For logging in and signing up, I used Lucia for authentication, and Supabase to manage all the images. The database is powered by Vercel Postgres and Prisma, ensuring everything runs smoothly and efficiently. Built with Next.js, the app is fast and optimized. This project showcases how I can bring together different technologies to create a user-friendly travel booking experience.
